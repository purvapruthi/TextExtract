===========

This project is about developing an OCR system to detect text in images. Due to complexity of natural scenes, illumination 
effects and non-uniformity of background, this task is a difficult Computer Vision problem. Our aim is to develop a more 
efficient system with better accuracy to recognize text in all kind of images using computer vision and 
machine learning techniques.
